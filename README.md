## About
This is a second iteration of my personal website. It's still in beta but so far includes Skills, Experience, Blog and pages generated by Gatsby. Currently hosted on Surge.sh and eventually GitHub Pages.

## Why the move?
My first personal website was created in my endeavor to learn web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, Ruby) and generated using Jekyll. Since then new technologies such as React, GraphQL, Node, and more have grabbed my attention. As someone who loves getting their hands dirty, it was a natural step to start import my old project into this new one. In my new challenge, I've found a lot of useful resources on Gatsby's site. I also received very useful tips from the online community.
