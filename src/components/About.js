        <p>Hi there, I'm Rick Boshae, a recent college grad living in Los Angeles, California. I love it here. I also love making software. Things I enjoy most about building software, aside from exploring new tech, are collaborating with others and learning something really awesome. I have a broad range of interests but some of my favorites are AI, Graphics, VR, Networking, Databases, Android Dev, and of course Web Apps. In fact, there really hasn't been a technology I haven't appreciated learning. Check out my site to learn more about my techincal background.</p>
