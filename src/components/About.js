        <p>Hi there, I'm Rick Boshae, a recent college grad living in Los Angeles, California. In a nutshell, you can say I am an aspiring Software Engineer with the spirit of an entrepreneur. What I enjoy most about building software, aside from exploring new tech, is exchanging ideas with others and really trying to create something awesome in the process.
        </p>
        <h3>Areas of Interest</h3>
        <p>I have a variety of interests but I tend to work on projects involving AI, Machine Learning, Graphics, VR, Networking, Databases, Android, and Web Applications.</p>
